# CODSOFT Internship Tasks

This repository contains all the tasks I completed during my **CodSoft Machine Learning Internship**.  
Each task is organized into separate folders with code, datasets (or dataset links), and results.

## Tasks Overview

ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Spam SMS Detection
- Built a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.
- Used techniques like **TF-IDF vectorization** and classifiers such as **Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression**.
- Evaluated model performance with **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**.

ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Developed a fraud detection system using a highly imbalanced dataset.
- Applied **data preprocessing, feature scaling, and Logistic Regression**.
- Evaluated the model using **precision, recall, and F1-score** to handle class imbalance.

 ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Handwritten Text Generation
- Implemented an **RNN-based model** to generate handwriting-style text.
- Trained on handwriting datasets (IAM / HKR).
- Explored deep learning techniques like **LSTM / GRU** for sequence generation.
